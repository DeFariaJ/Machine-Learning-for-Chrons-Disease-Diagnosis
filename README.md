# Machine-Learning-for-Chron's-Disease-Diagnosis
I aimed to determine whether machine learning, applied to metabolic data acquired using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS), can diagnose Chron's disease from easily accessible patient samples. More specifically, using R and its classyfire package I aimed to use support vectors machine to indentify a particular metabolic profile (patterns of peaks in the GCMS TIC) that can be used to recognise samples taken from patients with Chron's disease.

The sample data with highest predictive power to diagnose Chron's disease came from faeces data with an average accuracy of 79% against a permutation average accuracy of 50%.
